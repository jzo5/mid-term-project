# mid-term-project

To run the code, one should click on the python file attached and open it in an IDE. The package used was the datetime package. This package supplies modules and classes that manipulate the date and the time. It supports the year, date, minutes, seconds, hours, microseconds, and timezones. 

The point of the code is to notify someone that a place is closed on the weekend and open on weekdays. So, it determines whether or not the current date is a weekday or a weekend, and whether or not the store is open or closed. 

#1 is a very important part of the code, as it imports the package that makes the entire code possible.

#3 and #4 are also very important because they define what the date and time are and how they are displayed.

If I were to further expand on this code, I would add US holidays, and display that the store is also closed on holidays. I would go about this by either using the pandas package to import holidays, or by directly importing the holidays library.
